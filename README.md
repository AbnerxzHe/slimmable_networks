Illustration of universally slimmable networks. The same model can run at **arbitrary** widths.


## Run

0. Requirements:
    * python3, pytorch 1.0, torchvision 0.2.1, pyyaml 3.13.
    * Prepare ImageNet-1k data following pytorch [example](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/imagenet).
1. Training and Testing:
    * The codebase is a general ImageNet training framework using yaml config under `apps` dir, based on PyTorch.
    * To test, download pretrained models to `logs` dir and directly run command.
    * To train, comment `test_only` and `pretrained` in config file. You will need to manage [visible gpus](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/cuda-pro-tip-control-gpu-visibility-cuda_visible_devices/) by yourself.
    * Command: `python train.py app:{apps/***.yml}`. `{apps/***.yml}` is config file. Do not miss `app:` prefix.
    * Training and testing of MSCOCO benchmarks are released under branch [detection](https://github.com/JiahuiYu/slimmable_networks/tree/detection).
2. Still have questions?
    * If you still have questions, please search closed issues first. If the problem is not solved, please open a new.


## Technical Details

Implementing slimmable networks and slimmable training is straightforward:
  * Switchable batchnorm and slimmable layers are implemented in [`models/slimmable_ops`](/models/slimmable_ops.py).
  * Slimmable training is implemented in [these lines](https://github.com/JiahuiYu/slimmable_networks/blob/aeb10c9f437208603145e073ee730f0d7dbfa80f/train.py#L281-L289) in [`train.py`](/train.py).
